# MCP-WebResearch Improvements Plan

## Phase 1: High Priority Improvements

### 1. Intelligent Search Queue System [IN PROGRESS]
Implementation Steps:
1. Create SearchQueue class to manage search operations
   - Add queue data structure for pending searches
   - Implement rate limiting with exponential backoff
   - Add progress tracking and status reporting
   - Handle error recovery and retries

2. Add new tool endpoints:
   - batch_search: Queue multiple searches
   - get_queue_status: Check search queue progress
   - cancel_search: Cancel pending searches

3. Enhance search results aggregation:
   - Implement result deduplication
   - Add result sorting options
   - Improve error handling and recovery

4. Add queue persistence:
   - Save queue state between sessions
   - Handle interrupted searches
   - Implement queue recovery

Testing Criteria:
- Queue should handle at least 50 searches without triggering anti-bot measures
- Rate limiting should adapt to Google's response patterns
- Progress updates should be accurate and timely
- Results should be properly aggregated and deduplicated

### 2. Enhanced Content Extraction & Relevance Scoring [IN PROGRESS]
Implementation Steps:
1. Improve content relevance scoring:
   - Implement TF-IDF scoring
   - Add keyword proximity analysis
   - Add content section weighting
   - Implement readability scoring

2. Enhance content extraction:
   - Improve HTML structure parsing
   - Add support for common content patterns
   - Implement better content cleaning
   - Add structured data extraction

3. Add content summarization:
   - Implement extractive summarization
   - Add key points extraction
   - Generate section summaries
   - Preserve important metadata

4. Improve markdown conversion:
   - Enhance formatting preservation
   - Better handle tables and lists
   - Improve code block handling
   - Better preserve document structure

Testing Criteria:
- Content relevance scores should align with human judgment
- Extracted content should be clean and well-formatted
- Structured data should be accurately identified
- Summaries should capture key information
- Markdown output should be consistently formatted

## Implementation Notes:
- Each feature will be implemented incrementally
- Testing will be done after each major component
- Code reviews required before merging
- Performance benchmarks will be maintained
